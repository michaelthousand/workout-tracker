# workout-tracker
Python workout tracker app

I wanted to accomplish two things with this app, one more important than the other. The less important element is simply to track my own workouts and monitor my statistics without having to use an Excel spreadsheet.
The more important way is to simply show that I have some Python knowledge.

For now, the program is a text-based application that prompts users for information on workouts and then stores them in a pickled database file. Users can then search for specific days from the file or view statistics (e.g., workouts by month, average length of workout).

With this application, I have demonstrated:
    1. A basic working knowledge of coding in Python
    2. How to create a binary database file
    3. How to load that file and read/print the data
    4. How to manipulate the data from the file

This is just the first version of the program. Some key features I plan to introduce as time goes on include:
    1. A GUI (already started using tkinter)
    2. The ability to export to a CSV
    3. The ability to view weekly statistics rather than monthly or yearly

Any feedback or bugs identified would be greatly appreciated!
