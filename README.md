# Workout Tracker App 

## Program aims: 
I wanted to accomplish two things with this app, one more important than the other. The less important element is simply to track my own workouts and monitor my statistics without having to use an Excel spreadsheet.
The more important way is to simply show that I have some Python knowledge.

With version 2, I've encorporated a GUI so that users are not having to use the command console. They can enter in their data and it is stored to a pickled database file. Additionally, users can view their statistics, search for a particular day, export their workout database to a CSV file, and import an excel document.

With this application, I have demonstrated:
1. A basic working knowledge of coding in Python
2. How to create a binary database file
3. How to load that file and read/print the data
4. How to manipulate the data from the file
5. How to import files and store them
6. How to export files
7. Basic UI/UX design competency

## Modules needed: 
The following Python modules are needed for the program:
- PySimpleGUI
- Pickle
- Pandas

The program does also utilize the following more common modules:
- Date
- PathLib
- OS
- SYS

## Future plans:
I am hoping to incorporate a number of elements soon, including graphical representations of the data and a more polished user interface. The biggest change I want to make is converting the program to be an executable, preferably one that can run on any computer.

Any feedback or bugs identified would be greatly appreciated!
